### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Z_runner**, a French computer science student. I'm *passionate* about dev since I'm 15 years old, mainly developing *small scripts or other utility software*, but I like to discover new territories and learn how to use new technologies.

You will find here some projects I lead or have led, *often alone* but sometimes in collaboration, most of them unfinished but **all done by passion**. One of them is the Discord bot [Axobot](https://github.com/ZRunner/Axobot), one of my biggest projects at the moment, already *rewritten three times* entirely. As well as a few other Discord bots used for different communities. But also some **AI projects** like that [Darwin-based evolution game](https://github.com/ZRunner/evolution-game), a few utilities things, a [Minecraft-related pip library](https://github.com/ZRunner/fr-mc-python-lib) and even a [course to start in Python](https://github.com/ZRunner/Apprendre-le-Python). And if you are interested in my *student life*, feel free to have a look at our [TIPE](https://github.com/ZRunner/tipe), which was about *AI in a car circuit*, or this cool [Minecraft inspired game](https://github.com/ZRunner/raylib-kelawin) using the Raylib graphic lib.

If you want to **help me** on one of my projects, don't hesitate to contact me! Although I do most of them alone, it is rarely by choice, and I *appreciate having a little support* in my endeavors. On the other hand, I am also looking for an *internship abroad in a multinational company*, so if you can help me in this area, contact me via my **email address** (z.runner.mc@gmail.com)!

Oh and, one last thing: I love ducks ðŸ¦†
