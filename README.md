### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Z_runner**, a French computer science student. I'm *passionate* about dev since I'm 15 years old, mainly developing *small scripts or other utility software*, but I like to discover new territories and learn how to use new technologies.

You will find here some projects I lead or have led, *often alone* but sometimes in collaboration, most of them unfinished but **all done by passion**. One of them is the Discord bot [Zbot](https://github.com/ZRunner/ZBot), one of my biggest projects at the moment, already *rewritten three times* entirely. As well as a few other Discord bots used for different communities. But also some **website projects** like that [crowdin-like website](https://github.com/ZRunner/Z-Translator), a few utilities things, a [pip library](https://github.com/ZRunner/fr-mc-python-lib) and even a [course to start in Python](https://github.com/ZRunner/Apprendre-le-Python). And if you are interested in my *school life*, feel free to have a look at our [TIPE](https://github.com/ZRunner/tipe), which was about *AI in a car circuit*.

If you want to **help me** on one of my projects, don't hesitate to contact me! Although I do most of them alone, it is rarely by voluntary choice, and I *appreciate having a little support* in my endeavors. On the other hand, I'm also looking for some *small jobs* to make some money, so if you have this kind of things to offer me, or why not a paid *internship in a company*, contact me via my **email address** (z.runner.mc@gmail.com)!

So, one last fun fact to finish this presentation : I love ducks. Those who know me know why.
